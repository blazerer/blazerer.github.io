**Senior SDE** @ [Yandex.Translator](https://translate.yandex.com/) _(May 2018 - Jun 2019)_ <br>
Training translation models and development of data pipelines
<details align="justify">
 <summary>Details</summary>
 <ul>
  <li>Designed and developed end-to-end data aggregation pipeline: from application on device to table into the MR-storage</li>
  <li>Improved translation quality on Turkish language family via training new types of neural models, <b>waiting for <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220198159A1/">patent</a></b></li>
  <li>Implemented Alternatives-For-Translation backend based on neural language model API</li>
  <li>Tools: C++14, Python, NLTK, TF, Yandex MapReduce, Transformer RNNs, HG</li>
 </ul>
 <i>
 <br>
 <b>Alternatives-For-Translation Demonstration</b><br>
 Worked on an optimal extraction of probabilities' values from translation model to allow us to suggest alternative words in the translation.<br>
 As a result, we obtained server API for this task, and here you can see example of this tool's usage on en-ru language pair:

 <br>
 <b>Turkish Languages Translator and Yakut Language</b><br>
 Worked on the multi-language translation models with Tranformer RNNs and tried to find the best experiments' setup by preparation of corpora and tuning of models.<br>
 In the end, we achieved better quality in comparison to our baselines on the az-ru, kz-ru, uz-ru and other turk languages. <br>
 Yakut language is endangered one and our translator was the first registered translation system for it. As this language has high significance for the russian indigenous people, this achievement was reflected in the dedicated documentary:
